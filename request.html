We are not perfect, but we try to release as much information as possible. For privacy reasons, not all documents can be automatically added to our repo such as emails. However, if you are looking for a document you can request it and we will try to add it.

<h2>Procedure</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Know What You Want</strong> We cannot help you if you don't know specifically the file, document, message, email, picture, etc that you are looking for.</li>
<li><strong>Email Us</strong> Send an email to info@uspirates.org with the subject line "INFORMATION REQUEST"</li>
<li><strong>Wait</strong> We could have what you want in a day or in six months, we have a small team of volunteers who do a lot of work. Please be patient, we are not trying to hide anything and we will do our best to keep you informed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What to Expect</h2>

If you are requesting a document such as an email we may redact names, header information, and other information that we are obligated to (by law, privacy agreements, or good faith). You may also get an email back informing you that the information that you are looking for does not exist or that we cannot provide the information due to previously mentioned concerns. Copyrighted material cannot be uploaded to this service and as such we may not be able to share certain audio, video, or photo records that we have unless owned by the Pirate Party or someone who is releasing them under a Creative Commons licence.

<i>Please keep in mind that this site is a service run by volunteers of the Pirate Party. Some information may be missing, some of it we might not have access to. This site comes with no promises or commitments other than our best effort to keep it as up to date and accurate as possible</i>
